# Task Manager Prototype

This project was a coursework assignment for a UX module at the University of Leicester, with the task being to implement a frontend prototype of a task manager. This project had a strong emphasis on user experience. 

As part of this assignment, we were also tasked with creating a comprehensive high-fidelity design portfolio and performing a heuristic evaluation. I have also added this part of the assignment to the repostitory.

## Description

Task-Manager-Prototype is a small T prototype of a task manager web-application for users to create and manage their workload. The prototype includes a moderate level of interactivity.

The main development areas were:
- Home page
- Login & Signup page
- Tasks page
- Calendar page
- Navigation bar
- Search bar
- Side panel

This program was written using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.

## Instructions

All elements of the application can be accessed by downloading the zip file, extracting the files, opening index.html in your preferred web browser, and navigating via the user interface.
